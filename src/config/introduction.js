  text: 'Front‐end developer since the past 2 years. I was part of a very dynamic and lively dev team, my work was mostly focused on Javascript framework development (Vue.JS) and PHP CMS (Kirby CMS). I was in charge of the website components migration and evolution (patternLabs) which included continuous integration (Jenkins / GitHub) supported by an AGILE workflow (Scrum/Kanban). <br> Today I’m looking for a Front‐end position and completely open to work with any Javascript frameworks within a dynamic and motivated developer team.',
